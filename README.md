Developing web, softwares and mobile applications is a passion that started in me when I was 15 years old. A promising professional career was birthed as I was playing around with a hobby, creating HTML pages and implementing simple javascript functions. Now, I‚Äôve been in one of the most sought after professional careers in the technology world for 20 years.
